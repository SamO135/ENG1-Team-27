            <p>Unity takes place in an alternate universe where the University of York (UoY)
                is built around a large lake and the only way to travel between colleges is by boat.</p> 
            <p>The aim of the game is to defeat the evil Contantine College, while also avoiding being 
                sunk by rival colleges/pirates.</p>
            <p>Points may be accumulated passively by sailing around the map, or through in-game action 
                (e.g. sinking enemy vessels, or defeating/capturing enemy colleges); the player can also 
                gain plunder through attacking enemy ships and colleges.</p>

                <p>The game implements 'WASD' for movement mechnics and a point-and-click aiming system.</p>
