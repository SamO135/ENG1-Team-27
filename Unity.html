<p>Unity takes place in an alternate universe where the University of York (UoY) is built around a large lake and the only way to travel between colleges/buildings is by boat. The aim of the game is to complete some task, while also avoiding being sunk by rival colleges/pirates (along with a host of other challenges). Points may be accumulated passively by sailing around the map, or through in-game action (e.g. sinking enemy vessels, or defeating/capturing enemy colleges); the player can also gain plunder through attacking enemy ships and colleges, which can be spent on repairing their ship, acquiring provisions, and better weapons.</p>
